Facial Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System
Overview
This project aims to enhance the music listening experience by recommending tracks that match the listener's emotional state. The system uses facial emotion recognition to analyze the user's current mood and then suggests music that aligns with their emotions, providing a personalized and emotionally resonant experience.

Project Description
The Facial Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect emotions from facial expressions. The detected emotion is then mapped to a corresponding music genre or playlist that fits the user's current mood. This integration of emotion recognition with music recommendation not only enhances user engagement but also creates a more immersive and emotionally connected music experience.

Features
Emotion Detection: Utilizes a deep learning-based facial emotion recognition model to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.
Music Recommendation: Matches the detected emotion with a curated playlist or genre that aligns with the user's mood.
Real-Time Processing: Analyzes facial expressions in real-time to provide instant music recommendations.
User Customization: Allows users to customize or fine-tune their music preferences based on their emotional state.
Objective
The goal of this project is to create a seamless and intuitive music recommendation system that adapts to the user's emotions in real-time, making music listening a more personalized and enjoyable experience.
